### About

Remote sensing data of sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature, chlorophyll, and upwelling index data are available for 6 sites along the Galician coast (Spain).

Data can be visualised as a time series, which allows to select daily values and/or smoothed values over an averaged time window. The number of days to calculate the smoothing window can be selected by the user.

A date range can only be selected to visualise data as a time series or density plot.

In addition, <i>in situ</i> measures of water and air temperature data are available for three of the sites.

Data were processed within the framework of project [PERCEBES](https://www.unioviedo.es/percebes/)

#### Data sources

- Sea surface temperature (SST) data were obtained from the OSTIA model of the UK Met Office:
[https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html)

- Air temperature data (at 2m) were obtained from the ERA5-Land dataset from Copernicus:
[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form)

- Skin temperature (SKT, ground level) data were obtained from the ERA5-Land dataset from Copernicus:
[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form)

- Chlorophyll data were obtained from Ifremer's primary productivity model:
[http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html](http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html)

- A thermal upwelling index was calculated as the difference in SST between the coast and a point 350km offshore following Pfaff et al. (2011), using SST data from the OSTIA model. Thermal upwelling indices were calculated using the following formula:

    UPW = (SST<sub>offhore</sub> - SST<sub>onshore</sub>) / (SST<sub>offshore</sub> - T<sub>bottom</sub>)

    where, <i>SST<sub>offshore</sub></i> represents SST 350km offshore, <i>SST<sub>onshore</sub></i> represents SST close to the coast, and <i>T<sub>bottom</sub></i> is a constant temperature defined as 8ºC, representative of the bottom Eastern North Atlantic Central Water mass affecting the area of study (Ríos et al. 1992).

- <i>In situ</i> data of air and water temperature were collected within the framework of project PERCEBES using iButtons (one or two depending on the site and period).

SST, air temperature, chl-a, and upwelling index data were processed and provided by Nicolas Weidberg. <i>In situ</i> air and water temperature data were processed and provided by Alba Aguión.
