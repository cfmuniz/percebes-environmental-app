## App description

The following app displays plots of sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature, and chlorophyll in six sites along the Galician coast (displayed north to south). Data can be visualised as a time series or density plot for a period of interest, or as boxplot.

Data were processed within the framework of project [PERCEBES](https://www.unioviedo.es/percebes/).

## Data sources

- Sea surface temperature (SST) data were obtained from L4 OSTIA model of the UK Met Office: [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html)

- Air temperature data were obtained from the ERA5-Land dataset from Copernicus: [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form)

- Chlorophyll data were obtained from Ifremer: [http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html](http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html)
