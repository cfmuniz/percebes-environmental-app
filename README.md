## App description

The following app displays data for six sites along the Galician coast (displayed north to south).

- Satellite data: sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature, chlorophyll, and upwelling index are presented for the six sites.
Data can be visualised as a time series or density plot for a period of interest, or as boxplot.

- iButtons: <i>in situ</i> air and water temperature data are available for three of those sites.

Data were processed within the framework of project [PERCEBES](https://www.unioviedo.es/percebes/).

## Data sources

- Sea surface temperature (SST) data were obtained from L4 OSTIA model of the UK Met Office: [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html)

- Air temperature data were obtained from the ERA5-Land dataset from Copernicus: [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form)

- Skin temperature (SKT) data were obtained from the ERA5-Land dataset from Copernicus: [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form)

- Chlorophyll data were obtained from Ifremer: [http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html](http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html)
