## PERCEBES app

The following app displays environmental data in seven sites of the NW coast of Spain (Galicia). See map in the app for the specific positions of each site and the areas were environmental variables were measured.

Data available:

- Satellite data of sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature, chlorophyll-a, and upwelling index.
These data can be visualised as a time series or density plot for a period of interest, or as boxplot (for the entire period available).

- <i>In situ</i> data of air and water temperatures in three of the sites, measured with temperature loggers (<i>Maxim iButton®</i>).

Data were processed within the framework of project [PERCEBES](https://www.unioviedo.es/percebes).

## Data sources

- Sea surface temperature (SST) data were obtained from L4 OSTIA model of the UK Met Office: [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplUKMO_OSTIAv20.html)

- Air temperature data (at 2m) and ground level (skin temperature, SKT) were obtained from the ERA5-Land dataset from Copernicus: [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land)

- Chlorophyll data were obtained from Ifremer: [http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html](http://tds1.ifremer.fr/thredds/dodsC/MARC-IBI-OC5_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.html)
